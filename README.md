# POWER-BI-PROJECTS
These are some data cleaning, preparation and visualization projects I have worked on.
- ## Spotify streaming data dashboard
  This visualization answers business questions such as:
1. Which are the top 50 streamed artists overall?
2. How has the number of songs released and the amount of streams changed over time?
3. Which are the top 10 songs streamed by year?
4. What are the crucial factors for a song to be globally streamed? (Danceability, energy, positivity)

- ## Unicorn world data dashboard :
A unicorn is a privately held startup company valued at over $1 billion. This visualization answers business questions such as:
1. What is the continent with the most unicorns?
2. In what industries are there the most successful unicorns?
3. Which are the unicorns of each continent?
